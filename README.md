# Computer Science 2 - Spring 2025

## Collection of Work

This repository contains my work for **Computer Science 2** at UCF during the **Spring 2025** semester. It includes various Java assignments and projects that demonstrate my progression in the language and my understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Assignments

### 1. CourseCombinations.java
- **Description:** This program reads student names along with their enrolled courses and calculates how many course pairings exist among students who share the same class.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - HashMaps for efficient data storage and lookup
  - String manipulation and parsing input
  - Nested loops for comparing student schedules
  - Scanner for handling user input

### 2. ParenthesesCombinations.java
- **Description:** This program generates all valid combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given number \(n\) using a recursive backtracking approach.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Recursion and backtracking
  - StringBuilder for efficient string manipulation
  - Base case and recursive case handling
  - Generating combinatorial solutions
